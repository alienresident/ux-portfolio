<h3 id="toc_0">The Challenges</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Existing website <strong>configurator</strong> was too <strong>complicated</strong></li>
  <li>We conducted an <strong>eight-week discovery</strong>, talking to the <strong>7 SBD brands</strong> sell metal cabinets</li>
  <li>Regional <strong>salespeople</strong> were only focussed on <strong>big orders</strong> and were <strong>missing opportunities</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_1">The Goals</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create a configurator so <strong>consumers</strong> can <strong>easily explore</strong> all of the <strong>customization options</strong></li>
  <li>Build a <strong>reusable system</strong> that could meet the needs of <strong>all the brands</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Service consumers</strong> who only needed a <strong>small number</strong> of cabinets</li>
</ul>
