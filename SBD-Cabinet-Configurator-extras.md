### The Challenges

* Existing website **configurator** was too **complicated**
* We conducted an **eight-week discovery**, talking to the **7 SBD brands** sell metal cabinets
* Regional **salespeople** were only focussed on **big orders** and were **missing opportunities**

### The Goals

* Create a configurator so **consumers** can **easily explore** all of the **customization options**
* Build a **reusable system** that could meet the needs of **all the brands**
* **Service consumers** who only needed a **small number** of cabinets
